    "This is a data-cleaning assignment and is the second of two parts. This notebook is uploaded to our Github repository along with a csv of fake, dirty data called **recweekdata.csv**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you have a new file called **studentprofiles.csv** which has first and last names plus the genders of the students.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this assignment is to convert recweekdata.csv into processable data for statistics. Submit the following files through GitHub:\n",
    "1. A cleaned recweekdata.csv called **cleanrecweekdata3b.csv** **(5 points)**\n",
    "2. This notebook, containing the code (properly commented) that you used to clean the data **(5 points)**\n",
    "3. An html file of summary statistics from each column called **stats3b.html**. The requirements for the summary statistics are described below. **(10 points)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The outputs are similar to that of Assignment 3A, except that you will now use Pandas instead of Python lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "This entire assignment (3B) is worth 20 points.\n",

    "Upload your output files to your Github repositories. Make sure to send an email to **joben.ilagan@gmail.com** once you're done.\n",

    "Note: I understand you all need to review for LT 2. Think of this Assignment as practice. It's not meant to take you as long as 3A.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bonus Points:\n",
    "* +2 if submitted over (or before) the weekend (July 13-14)\n",
    "* +2 if CSS and div tags are used (but please don't spend too much time on this because you still need to review for the Long Test)"
